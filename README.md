### Flexbox Project: Landing Page

This is the second project assignment of the Odin Project. The goal is to create an entire webpage with all the parts that one would usually find.

In this project I will use all the things I learned so far about **HTML** and **CSS**, with the main focus being on **Flexbox**.
